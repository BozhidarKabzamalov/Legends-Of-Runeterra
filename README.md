The application consists of a Vue.js front-end which draws information from a JSON file and then displays the information in a user-friendly manner.

The lazy loading design pattern is utilized in order to defer the rendering of the images until they are in the viewport of the user, and in return reduce the website's bandwidth usage. Moreover, all images are provided in WebP format with fallback to PNG format on browsers that do not support WebP.

The application is completely responsive as a result of the use of CSS3 media queries.
